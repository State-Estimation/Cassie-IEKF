# Cassie-IEKF
This repository contains an example Matlab/Simulink implementation of the contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter. The filter was designed for use on a Cassie-series biped robot, however it can be easily modified for other systems. The included measurement dataset was generated through a simulation of Cassie walking.
